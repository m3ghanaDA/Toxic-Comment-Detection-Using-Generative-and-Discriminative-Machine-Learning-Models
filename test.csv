673676199.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Diacritics: Moving forward==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:NEWLINE_TOKEN* – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.NEWLINE_TOKEN* – this encouragement to count ``hits`` just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word ``general``. However, this bit seems clear that the ``modifications`` are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.NEWLINE_TOKEN* This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is ``the common name`` here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? ``[V]ersions of  word`` above should mean that ``the common `` is the same with or without the diacritical marks.NEWLINE_TOKENIs it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is ``Santa Fe`` not ``Santa Fé`` despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are ``Santa Fe`` with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure ``general`` in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of ``and reference works`` strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the ``hit-counting`` aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like ``Boss`` and ``roman`` , now? heh, heh, heh)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my ``mate``. Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the ``Roman`` you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrongNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReply:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings? I dunno about you but for most guys that could be a hot bimbo. In both comics and series Harley has been portrayed as a slut, sleeping with her teachers for a better note, killing his lover without caring and even was hinted as a playful lesbian in Hush.

I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it.

Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute.

I think I sent in several corrections to Standard Notes and Research Papers over the years then I just got bored with it. To take just one example, the SN refers to the 1935-1945 swing as being meaningless because ``National Labour candidates contributed 1.6% to the National total in 1935``. True to say that but totally irrelevant: most voters in 1935 understood National Labour to be in effect Conservative, and it was only the Macdonald family which thought of it as being Labour. What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others.

The vast majority of those in the South and North didn't practiced it. Central Nairs are mostly Charna Nairs, who rank lower than Kiryathils of the North and Illath of South. (2) Polyandry was widely practiced in Kerala, and the main practitioners of it were not Nairs, but lower ranking Savarna castes such as Kammalans. (3) Sources about polyandry are written by a few European researchers, who don't have first hand experience about this, and many of them haven't even visited Kerala. The last recorded instance of polyandry among Nairs date back to mid-19th century (Not 1900). (4) There are travelogues written by many European explorers like Duarte Barbosa, and none of them mentions polyandry. But every single one of them mentions about the martial traditions of Nairs.

680793161.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::::::I said clearly ``from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical`` date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by ``believed-to-be historical``, as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the ``theological reasons`` the point too is why would they be so ``vested`` if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was ``587`` instead of ``607`` (according to the whole ``2520 years`` view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the ``last days`` anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the ``end times`` if that's the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by ``believed-to-be historical date`` not just solely ``theological``.   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole ``Gentile Times`` thing (as you know of course) for the whole ``Messiah's Kingdom`` breaking in for the ``end times`` etc etc.    It's whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they ``mis-translated`` Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say ``I begin`` or ``I am beginning`` it does NOT say what you said of ``already beginning``.   There's no real difference between the word ``beginning`` and ``start of``.    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says ``I am starting off``.   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God ``already started off``.   So?    Because in all versions the word ``already`` is NOT there.   Whether you use the word ``beginning`` or ``start``.   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are ``already beginning`` or ``first`` or ``starting off``.   Because if it's ``already beginning`` as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say ``I am beginning with you`` (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your ``already beginning`` negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........`  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

Subsequently, the puerta rican loving dirtbags can invalidate any consensus and ignore ever one that is in search of the truth.

I have no problem with retaining the ``big three`` concept.  The sentence in question just needs to be written a little better.  We should eliminate the words ``big three`` and replace them with something more descriptive and less simplistic.  I like your wording, ``...three design elements...firepower, protection, and mobility.`` Perhaps this could be used to replace ``big three`` with some additional wording.  How about, The three principal design elements ....?``  For the record, reliability refers to the entire weapon system, not just how well the tank gets around the battlefield.  For example, if the main gun sights don't maintain proper alignment, you can't hit anything.  Reliability right?

This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is Devanāgari; the script/font-system for English is Roman script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRecommendations:NEWLINE_TOKEN#Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose ``underline links -> Never``. Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for ``justify paragraphs``, otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.NEWLINE_TOKEN#All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on facts—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's help page for editing in general. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately. NEWLINE_TOKEN#Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the ``normal`` keyboard with this software, typing ga would give ग and ghaa would give घा.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. IPA (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); UNO (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for technical and specialized vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is recommended and usually   : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENFor example, Kentucky's hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the ``United We Stand Divided We Fall`` motto is totally opposite of most ``State's rights`` mottos in the South.  Economically we area somewhere in between, having a better economy and population growth than most Midwestern states, but still behind true sunbelt states like Georgia, Tennessee or the Carolinas. Food and accent wise we are definatly southern.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs For Louisville,I think that the ``old stock`` native Louisvillians are  midwestern in accent and attitude, but Jefferson's County nearly doubled it's population from 1940-1960 with people mostly from south central and western Kentucky which really altered the culture. Econmoically, Louisville today has less of a heavy industry based economy  city than it use to be, but instead has employment concentrated in a few ``high tech`` automobile factories and in the service industry, making it less Cincinnati and more like Nashville. , April 20.`  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

23601472.0,"SDATA_6 :   September 2005 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the great things about Bayesian stats is that you can do things directly rather than indirectly, as in frequentist stats. For example, in frequentist stats you can't attach a probability to a hypothesis, so you can't talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. Instead, you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis, which is not really what you want. Bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle (though the sums may get hard in practice). You attach a prior probability to the hypothesis, multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it. The point I was making was that probabilities of zero and one make poor choices as priors. (I am not saying that Bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities, just when they are used as priors.) Your mention of linear models and so on suggests that you are thinking in terms of Bayesian methods of parameter estimation, whereas I was thinking in terms of Bayesian hypothesis testing. 15:28, 20  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?

The article is in a rather sorry state, and I always had it at the top of my list but never quite got around to it. Indeed, there is much work to be done. I am trying to make the article follow the guidelines listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries. As my model, I have other featured articles on countries, such as Belgium, Turkey, and Germany. The problem is that now there is little structure to the Moldova article and much random (and some inaccurate) information. Of course, if there is relevant data, I don't want it lost, so if it's just too detailed for the main article, it should be moved to the sub-articles. My idea for a schedule was to first create the skeleton of the article, meaning that only the sections from the Countries projects should be kept and rest integrated or moved. Then, all the sections need to be reworked, some to be expanded, others made more compact, others need sources (and most existing sources need to be changed to standard formats). Then, various issues of style need to be changed (i.e. to make the article pretty), which means finding some nice images, making the tables look nicer, etc. And finally, the article will need to be copy-edited and checked for errors. So if you want to help, it would be great if you could work on any of those aspects, or any other. See you around!     : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing ``security reasons`` as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed. `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her.

Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again.

Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally ``x86`` was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with ``86``, such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as ``x86`` are IA-32 compatible software, and use ``x64`` or ``x86-64`` differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86?

What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! ``x86`` is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture.

Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit ``won`` the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was ``Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest``. End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit ``won`` the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his ``pinning the wrong Harris``.

They varied greatly from state to state as to their harshness and restrictiveness. Although the codes granted certain basic civil rights to blacks (the right to marry, to own personal property, and to sue in court), they also provided for the segregation of public facilities and placed severe restrictions on the freedman's status as a free laborer, his right to own real estate, and his right to testify in court. Although some Northern states had black codes before the Civil War, this did not prevent many northerners from interpreting the codes as an attempt by the South to reenslave blacks. The Freedmen's Bureau prevented enforcement of the codes, which were later repealed by the radical Republican state governments.  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (Megalonyx). The species was ultimately named Megalonyx jeffersonii in his honor.Jefferson, Thomas, ``A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia``, Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. The ``certain bones`` consisted of three large claws and associated smaller bones. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct lion which he named Megalonyx (``giant claw``). In 1799, Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar officially named it Megalonyx jeffersonii.Jefferson, Thomas (1799), ``A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia``, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 4 pp. 246-260.Wistar, Caspar (1799), ``A Description of the Bones Deposited, by the President, in the Museum of the Society, and Represented in the Annexed Plates``, Transactions, pp. 526-531, plates.

You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an ``encyclopedia that anyone can edit`` means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a ``body of law`` as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call ``wikilawyering``)   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as ``reliable`` and ``NPOV`` are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo don't edit war - discuss on the talk page.

The Coriolis effect is a change-of-coordinates force (and thus bears intriguing similarities with gravity, whether this means anything or not is unclear). When you move from one coordinate system to one that is rotating with respect to the first, then the equations of motion for a particle acquire an extra term: the coriolis term (and one other of second order in omega but we'll neglect that). So: if you wish to formulate the equations of motion for air on the surface of the earth, it is natural do to it in a coordinate system stationary wrt the earths surface: in that case, you end up with a coriolis force. You could, if you wished, write the equations in a system non-rotating wrt the fixed stars (perhaps ignoring the rotation of the earth round the sun). In this system, there would be no coriolis effect and hence no coriolis force. However there would be a very rapidly moving lower boundary to account for and this would be deeply inconvenient. since the coriolis term is easy to incorporate, there is no particular reason to do this. But... this is only the coordinate system in which you choose to write your equations. It has no effect on the physics, and cyclones continue to rotate no matter which system you describe them in.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe coriolis effect is *not physics*: it is kinematics.  19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC).NEWLINE_TOKEN[end of copied section]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWilliam M Connolley is simultaneously saying that the coriolis effect is physics, and that it isn't.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn article about the coriolis effect should explain the following:.NEWLINE_TOKENIf (hypotherically speaking) a low pressure area would form on a non-rotating planet, then the air would flow towards the low pressure area and the pressure gradient would very rapidly be leveled.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut that is not what is happening on Earth. On Earth, air starts flowing around a low pressure area, amazingly, it tends strongly to flow perpendigular to the pressure gradient, and it can take weeks for a low pressure area to become leveled again  So there must be a physical mechanism that performs a restructuring of the direction of wind flow.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA general coordinate transform transforms the entire picture in one go, if you employ a coordinate transformaton to a rotating coordinate system on, say, a large grid, then the grid will turns around as a whole, with the whole picture remaining in a fixed form.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat is not what happens in the atmosphere! If you let go lots of weather balloons in the area of a low pressure area forming, then over time the positions of the balloons in the circling winds will be thoroughly mixed. The more central parts of the system rotate faster.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWilliam says that the coriolis effect is to be understood as purely a cosmetic change: a coordinate transformation, that does not alter the physics taking place. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut Willam also believes the following:NEWLINE_TOKENfrom: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley/Coriolis_effectNEWLINE_TOKEN:The Coriolis force plays a strong role in weather patterns, where it affects prevailing winds and the rotation of storms, as well as in the direction of ocean currents. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, friction plays a relatively minor role, as air parcels move mostly parallel to each other. Here, an approximate balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis force exists, causing the geostrophic wind, which is the wind effected by these two forces only, to blow along isobars (along lines of constant geopotential height, to be precise). Thus a northern hemispheric low pressure system rotates in a counterclockwise direction, while northern hemispheric high pressure systems or cyclones on the southern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise manner, as described by Buys-Ballot's law.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is why I recognize that there are two contexts, that both called 'coriolis effect'. NEWLINE_TOKENOne context is about physical mechanisms, the other is about coordinate transformation. NEWLINE_TOKEN |    : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

I've voted on some of them, mostly because other editors have solicited my input (I think with more confidence in what I would opine than is merited).  My votes on those have been mixed, and have depended on how specific the topics are, and whether I think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion.  But I'm neither one of those people who votes ``keep`` for anything with the word ``Jewish`` in it; nor am I an editor who votes ``delete`` whenever I see the word (we have some of each, and I think both are acting with a bit of bad faith).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I am, however, very offended by abuse of the administrative systems of WP in violation of WP:POINT.  I guess you're a newbie, and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures.  We all start out that way.  In actual fact, there is a ``criteria for speedy deletion`` that allows removal of pages that have been previously deleted by AfD.  There are a lot of rules floating around, and they are not all consistent with each other, so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing all, or even most, of them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:But an AfD is for a very specific thing, and something very different from your spurious nomination.  FWIW, Arniep also violated WP:POINT by massively nominating ``Jewish Foo`` lists that he actually wanted kept.  And he got blocked for 48 hours (rightly) as a warning.  What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.  And it is not a way to get even with editors who voted ``delete`` on some other page that you believe is conceptually equivalent to the page you nominate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:There are lots of pages that I think should be better, and where I think the editors are putting in material that is not encyclopedic, and where the structure of the article is not optimal (maybe it needs refactoring into subpages).  As a good WP citizen who follows Wikiquette, I raise those issues on the article talk pages.  I attempt edits to the page directly.  Perhaps I create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what I think it should be like.

And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most ``notorious``...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. ``The Ten-String Guitar`` in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact ``worthless`` because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' ``short hands`` being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not ``frequently`` the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as ``crutches`` for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN, you know nothing.`  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.

672452991.0,"SDATA_6 :  `, 21 July 2015 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Sure.  So in this particular case, here is what I found.  You've been name-dropped in WaPo.  Usually, that would make you an auto-implied-endorsement... but rather than being 'strategist' or some kind of 'senior advisor' or whatever, your job title was CTO... somewhat strange for a political campaign to *have* somebody with that job-title.  Hence, I didn't count it as an auto-implied-endorsement, but looked further.  This is relatively unambiguous:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Ron Schnell, computer programmerhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/06/30/supreme-court-passes-on-google-oracle-case-rand-pauls-campaign-hosts-a-hackathon/ at NSUhttp://cec.nova.edu/faculty/adjlist.html NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: But there is some wiggle room, there.  And thus, the question is:  1) per WP:ABOUTSELF, is that a public endorsement, by a ``celebrity programmer`` of sorts?  or alternatively, is that a public endorsement, by a ``celebrity professor`` of sorts?  I originally put you down as a prof, because of your earliest press being for NYU, and your current job being adjunct prof, and your years at Syracuse.  You have obviously been a programmer, but you've also obviously been in academia (of one type or another ... sysadmin at ITS counts in my book) for a very long time.  Paul has specific platform-planks that impact the world of computer science, and the computer industry:  net neutrality, NSA data-collection, and more.  There are likely to be copyright-related issues in the 2016 election (cf the oracle-vs-google lawsuit over whether the fundefs in an API are ``copyright`` or rather ``fair use`` in terms of Java libcalls  this is probably more important than the look and feel lawsuits of the 1980s).  So, I could see a case where as a programmer-slash-professor, you would endorse based on your understanding of the economic impact in the computer industry, much like Walter Block endorsed as an academic who is an economics prof (despite disagreeing with Paul on specific issues like the correct governmental level for dealing with vaccinations  they agree on economics and thus Block endorsed).  Then there is the third possibility, which is the endorsement as a staffer.  Although you are a new face as a political consultant, that doesn't necessarily make a staffer-endorsement less valuable; in some ways, it makes your endorsement more wiki-noteworthy, because you *are* an outsider, who wasn't hired based on your implied-and-pre-existing endorsement, like most of the professional-political-staffer-hires tend to be.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::       Finally, I will point out that per WP:BLP, wikipedians are pretty careful when making statements about BLPs, yourself included, as well as Rand Paul.  It is 'saying something' about Paul when somebody is listed as endorsing him, but even more so, it is 'saying something' about you when we list you as an endorsement-giver.  Since this is a borderline case, wikipedians usually just defer to what the BLP wants to happen (in this case you).  If you want to be listed as an endorsement-giver, because it is a true statement, per WP:COI you should not insert yourself.  But I already inserted you, along with a ton of other staffer-endorsements (most of the implied variety but one or two that were more carefully quotation-laden).  And that was before we became wiki-involved during the AfD of the Dunnet videogame, so it still stands an the action of an uninvolved editor.  In other words, if you'd rather be left off the list, that's fine, just say so, and why.  If somebody else inserts you into the article, don't remove yourself from the article-mainspace, per wiki-COI behavioral rule#1, but instead ask for assistance.  It will also help if you post something WP:ABOUTSELF to your blog, which says that you are not yet formally endorsing any candidate in the race, although that's not necessary at present (only if some other editor re-inserts you).  On the other hand, if after reading this, and looking over the list at Endorsements for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016, you end up deciding that you do belong on the list (either under the academia-subsection or under the ce  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst.  Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts.  The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine.  Your body is only about 1% salt.  Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine.  The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively.  Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either.  And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of.  And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo viewers of the show: don't do it!

Indeed, were FISA and Title III interpreted to impede the President’s ability to use the traditional tool of electronic surveillance to detect and prevent future attacks by a declared enemy that has already struck at the homeland and is engaged in ongoing operations against the United States, the constitutionality of FISA, as applied to that situation, would be called into very serious doubt. In fact, if this difficult constitutional question had to be addressed, FISA would be unconstitutional as applied to this narrow context. Importantly, the FISA Court of Review itself recognized just three years ago that the President retains constitutional authority to conduct foreign surveillance apart from the FISA framework, and the President is certainly entitled, at a minimum, to rely on that judicial interpretation of the Constitution and FISA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.

They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.

Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena ``get nasty`` with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people ``narrow``.  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.

262774294.0,"SDATA_6 :  `[outdent]David,  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article. Copyvio or no, anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes. If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now. I repeat my previous advice: base an article on Sport England. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on George's talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL. You'll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern; personally I think that it is manageable, although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral. The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the question of the image. I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the (separately deleted) logo. This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL. I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fair-use rationale. It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logo/identity and release it for others to do with what they wish - are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it? However, if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it (by clicking ``Upload file`` on the menu on the left) making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information - the upload page will walk you through this. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject. You'll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together. Cheers,   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

This study demonstrates that the demography of populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be directly sensitive even to modest deviations in the local thermal environment. These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCompass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWorship Rights NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue?

If you honestly believe (b) or (c) are in some way ``blurry``, then I agree you are entitled to your own opinion. If you do not find (b) and (c) to be blurry at all, but less Jagged, then you realize the importance of this effect. You would then realize that AA does not cause your video quality to be blurry, but it is more likely that your TV is causing the blurryness. I know this because TVs are already too blurry for my personal preference. The PS2 does not actually need AA. It is not ment for use with an HD TV. However, if you were to use a PS2 with an HD TV, you would realize the presence of massive jaggies in comparison to the xbox's picture quality. Just incase you did not know, you compare screenshots by seeing how they would look on the highest quality screen, prefferedly the same screen unit. You do not compare them by putting them on an old tv from the 1980s. A 1980s TV would make the PS2's graphics look far more competitive with the xbox's graphics. However, an HD TV would not. I have not  made any false statements as far as I know. I assume that was directed at the AA bust. The reason I said the PS2 lacked AA is not because it could not do it, but because it does not do it. That last statement is sort of like saying a low end Dell computer is more powerful than a super computer because it has sold 100x as many units. This is not about grabbing ilrelevent facts such as sales to divert the fact that you're wrong and can't prove otherwise, this is about how the xbox is more powerful than the PS2 and the screenshots are clear evidence. ``I never said PS2 is more powerful.`` is what you said. ``Xbox is not more powerful then PS2`` is the arguement. The architectures being different does not make it unfair to compare them. You can easily compare them with performance tests. The xbox excels farther at it's target goal than the PS2, therefor it is more powerful. Is there an arguement to that? Does the PS2's 6.2 GFLOPS (relative to the xbox's 2.9 GFLOPS) suddenly make the PS2 more powerful? Does a meaningless benchmark magicly make the PS2 better at doing something that the xbox is actually better at doing? No it does not.

You can censor me and block me all you want – you’ve got the power – but you can’t make me confess to wrongs of which I am innocent. Not yet, anyway. And you can’t make me say that you’re right, when you are as wrong as hell. It’s about time somebody talked back to you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“If you were to discuss your edits, you won't [sic] be in this position right now.” (Since I had already discussed my edits, physicq’s statement above is a case of “a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.”)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat’s funny peculiar, because wikicensors with the correct politics somehow never have to “discuss” their “edits.” They just go and censor people with whom they disagree, and then demand that the censees justify the worth of the censored passages or links or footnotes. And guess what? The censees’ explanations, no matter how well-founded and eloquent, are never sufficient to make the censors change their minds. Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, ``commissars``?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed. That the censors continue demanding such arguments is because they have a sadistic glee for wasting other people’s precious time and energy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn case an open-minded (but perhaps less experienced) reader should suspect that I am just engaging in bluster, I had already made my argument in my previous entry on this page (which AuburnPilot has archived in a handsome tan box at the bottom of  under the uncivil category, “spam”) for why the footnotes and links I inserted were legitimate, but physicq aka physicq210 derided those arguments as a “polemic, complete with fallacious personal attacks,” and mocked my criticism of his abuse of authority as “whining.” In one case, I pointed out that the external link that AuburnPilot defamed as “spam” and censored, was a classic magazine article related to the  Racial Profiling Hoax.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Speaking of which, Wikipedia's Racial profiling article is hopelessly POV through the censors’ deleting of links to articles debunking the hoax, and inserting of links to fraudulent “literature” such as thoroughly debunked work by the ACLU.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of a footnote that AuburnPilot also defamed as “spam” and censored, he cut the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the  Duke Rape Hoax, which was published by the most brilliant, reliable magazine on the Web, VDARE.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBTW, AuburnPilot asserts that the sources in question are not “reliable” or “verifiable,” and do not maintain “neutrality.” Aside from the fact that thousands of Wikipedia articles are transparent political propaganda, or no more than love or hate letters to certain public figures (particularly entertainers or athletes), AuburnPilot has misrepresented the Wikipedia rule on neutrality. There is no requirement that every source be neutral (as opposed to reliable and verifiable), only that every Wikipedia article be neutral.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWP:NPOVNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views that have been published by a reliable source.

If I have already made my best argument for including the aforementioned links and footnotes, and physicq aka physicq210 responds by misrepresenting what I said, claiming that I have made no attempt at supporting my position, and referring to my defense as “whining,” what possible reason could I have for continuing such a charade?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlus, why should I be on the defensive? If I were dealing with fair, reasonable people, that might make sense. But fair, reasonable people would not do as AuburnPilot did, and first censor my edits, and then demand I justify their value on the talk pages. (And physicq would not have responded to an edit war by throwing in with AuburnPilot, immediately blocking me, and charging me with “disruptive edits.” That alone is proof of physicq’s unfitness as an administrator.) No, AuburnPilot would not have censored my work, but would have asked me on the talk page why I thought it belonged. No, strike that. He would have hit the links and read the articles in question.

Although the Church survived the revolution, according to the ideology of the new republic it could no longer remain a separate estate with its own possessions. Therefore, the new government confiscated the land and assets belonging to the Church and auctioned them off to help resolve the financial problems that had led to the revolution. The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy.

LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``The fifth meaning of the phrase 'Beat Generation' is the influence of the literary and artistic activities of poets, filmmakers, painters, writers and novelists who were working in concert in anthologies, publishing houses, independent filmmaking, and other media.

As for the national/international issue, they clearly state that NGOs whose activities are purely local are only notable if they have received national/international coverage. The Circle of Reason has received national (Harvard Pluralism Project) attention for local (Minnesota Secular Bible Study) activities, and also has international activity - groups in other countries. The guidelines state that once notability has been established by independent sources (Harvard Pluralism Project, Star Tribune), primary sources (TCOR website, Dutch Cirkel website etc) can be used to provide information. Distracting readers from sourced evidence for notability is not really a concern; establishment of notability is the 'qualification' for inclusion in Wikipedia, once the topic is so qualified the article should contain all relevant information on the topic that can be cited to reliable sources.

People don't understand the problem and people have also failed to communicate the problem to users who are just schoolboys. Many of them are simply not aware that prior to being named yadav they were registered as Ahir in british census. so, instead of bringing yadava rulers of the past they need to show Ahir Yadava connection. Here is MSA Rao's statement on the subject-``Historical & Semihistorical Evidences are available for equating Ahir with Yadava.`` . Boys you will do a great job if you just google, all the stuffs I had added in Ahir as Yadava section. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne important observation in this regard is All historical yadavas found till date has been traced to abhira ancestry. historical Yadavas story bigins with Trikuta(800AD), who were Abhira. There is a very long gap between Yadavas of mythical era and those historians have traced so this would always be a matter of debate, and this has nothing to do with the arrival date of Abhira, because most of Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata has been written between 6th and 8th century AD, and are suspected to be backward projection. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne important fact regarding Yadavas is that, though it means descent from Yadu, actually it means claiming Krishna lineage. Cult of krishna has no eveidence of existence before the beginning of the Christian era. so, dynasties had actually two kinds of claim, one from Krishna the God of Abhira, and another from Krishna the hero of Mahabharata. Again those who have adopted Krishna of Mahabharata did so only after it was written. These people are suspected to have styled on that line. There are Scholars(Check Rusell,B.V.) who believe Krishna of mahabharata is actually a cunning cruft of Brahmanas,and episodes related to him in Mahabharata are actually later days interpolations, done after stealing the god and philosophy of abhira tribe.  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary ``Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp``. You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with ``Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them``,  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been ``work``, requiring ``thought`` and ``effort``. Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn't even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism ``believed that Jesus Christ was a human being``, and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

I noticed that you had edited the British National Party article recently and that was what I said, and which I stand by. I did not even look at your edit and even if I had I could not conclude or intend to say that you are a supporter of the BNP. If it was possible to read it that way, then I apologise. I have edited the remarks to make it make sense (I see now that it was incomplete). NEWLINE_TOKEN:It is true that you and Steven Slater have edited the article about the BNP which is a tiny and insignificant extremist party in the UK. I did find it strange that two people who edit that article should descend and comment on the NPOV issue raised by Jesanj; especially when Jesanj has also mentioned in the past a claim that I did not understand at all until I googled the matter and it led me to a LaRouche organization website. I have no idea if he did get that comment from Larouche or invented it himself independently but this has aroused suspicion because the LaRouche organization seems to me to be an extreme political organization not at all unlike the BNP. There is also another connection I have found between Jesanj's edits and the LaRouche organization which for the time being I will not reveal publicly. Furthermore, an editor who was found to be a sock of a known LaRouche editor and who was apparently editing from a Larouche IP address was actively involved in supporting Jesanj in another edit dispute I have had with Jesanj. That user has now been blocked from editing WP. Here we have an editor (Jesanj) trying to justify that Palin was talking about NICE when there is no evidence for that. And now at NPONV we have a group of editors with editing connections to matters of extreme right wing / Nazi like organizations all seem to wish to see preserved in WP the same thing. An association, no matter how remote and unlikely between NICE and Death Panels. Jesanj also wants to connect NICE and the IPAB! Both are non mainstream (or extremist) views, which is why I keep removing his multiple attempts to add POV bias to WP. The combination of factors i describe is, I believe, a prima facia case for believing that there may not be any independence in the views being expressed by SOME of the editors who have commented on the NPOV issue. The simple fact is that Palin did not refer to NICE as a death panel and as far as we know, she did not even wish to imply that. She has had plenty of opportunity to clarify her comments and not once has she mentioned NICE. The position of the UK journalists is absurd because it has no foundation and as far as anyone can tell, so only an extremist would wish to support that view. To repeat it twice in different places when there is already a reference to NICE as a potential ``death panel`` candidate in the article is taking liberties, and up with this we should not put. Which is why I deleted two of the references and left the third in.    `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

The information about Aristotle's connection to the Macedonian court is abundantly mentioned: in the first sentence of the article, and in the second sentence of ``Life``: ``His parents were Phaestis and Nicomachus, who became physician to King Amyntas of Macedon.``  It looks to me like the article is doing a good job being factual; theories like ``makes their relationship a very logical one`` are in some danger of being original research, though I don't know enough about Aristotle's family to say whether there is meaningful ancient evidence that goes beyond the way the article represents things.  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

For example if I can remember correctly, Ashley has used the magistral pin in almost every match she has wrestled in the WWE, aswell as clothesline varations. Deleting Ashley's moves and saying that they are not signature moves, is the same as deleting Stratus' Spinebuster, or Victory Roll, becasue she doesn't use them to finish matches. If that is the case, we should go on every wrestler's profile and delete every move that is not used to finish matches because they are not ``signature``.

I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia.

If you want to abuse your position as a trusted editor here, you say the editor you have a difference of opinion with, is ``disruptive`` when he or she simply has a different opinion - as you so correctly mentioned. Confidently demonstrating with reliable sources that a statement is an encyclopedic statement appropriate to be on WP is not disruptive editing. However the term disruptive editing is one of a number of terms abused by abusive editors on WP.

It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKEN'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, ``In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words ``comfort women`` are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as ``yanggongju`` or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000.

May I point out that Malaysia and Indonesia, which are described as Muslim countries (as they officially indeed are), contain very substantial Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. (See the CIA World Fact Book .) Moreover, many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region. North Borneo and New Guinea, for example, are very large geographical areas in Malaysia and Indonesia which only have a marginal Muslim presence; the Moluccas in Indonesia are at least 50% Christian; Bali is famously Hindu. Overall, Malaysia is some 60% Muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus-80% circumcised category as it appears on the map. But given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the Indonesian Archipelago, it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way.

Brown (he was also an Anglican oriest and the author of several books) says this about the home «He had inaugurated a Home for orphaned children in a one-time public-house, receiving for care and attention children commended to him by the local authority.» (one of the things he mentions about St Hilary in Twenty Years is that it had four public houses) In the next paragraph he says: «His church had been gradually enriched with painted choir stalls, pictures, statues and several altars of stone. Its appearance was neither exactly Roman, nor medieval, but largely sui generis, every ornament and gift the result of love.» (Brown: A Century for Cornwall; p. 98) The children's home is described in chapter 18 of Twenty Years.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJust take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENthe Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENContrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”NEWLINE_TOKENThough (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

630377949.0,"SDATA_6 :   The very reason why there are only 52 bits used for addressing in PAE mode is that the very first 8086 processor using segmentation to address physical memory, where segment register such as CS is 16bit but referring 20-bit long segments after shifting 4 bits to the left. Keeping this schema, if there were 32bit real mode, then 20 bits (used for referring segments) + 32 bits (base address) = 52 bits (for logical addresses). But this is not the truth, but just a guide to draw the reason why. In Intel64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, it says M is an abbreviation for MAXPHYADDR, which is at most 52, where M is used in PDE, PTE and PPDE without further explanation. But I don't believe, for AMD64 architecture, that would be the extreme limit for the physical addressing. If further AMD64 processor gets rid of legacy mode completely, then there would potentially 63bits for addressing physical memory rather than 52bits, like it in Itanium architecture.

Second, the theme of outback gothic has been dissembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films.`` I took a look at the only citation in the reinstated text, and I see a key problem - it doesn't support the text in the article. The source doesn't support the sentence ``A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape.``, it doesn't use the term ``outback gothic``, and doesn't mention most of the quoted films, such as Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris, Shame etc etc. In fac the only sentence which the source supoprts is the one that was already in the article before the edit was made: ``Saw (2004) and Wolf Creek (2005) are credited with the revival of Australian horror.`` For now I am reverting the edit.

As a matter of fact, Vince Bugliosi stated in a recent interview that ``Helter Skelter`` was NOT on Manson's mind and the killers had the instinct in them already to commit the murders. This interview can be found on ``YouTube`` and is what I consider to be a total contradiction to Bugliosi's past claims. This is how I feel the following article sections should read:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN{Manson allegedly believed in what he called ``Helter Skelter,`` a term taken from the song of the same name by The Beatles. It was said Manson believed Helter Skelter to be an impending apocalyptic race war, which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the Beatles' song but this is debatable since Manson never publicly confirmed anything of the sort. According to prosecutor Vince Bugliosi, Manson supposedly believed his murders would help precipitate that war. From the beginning of his notoriety, this connection with rock music linked him with a pop culture in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the macabre.}NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN{Helter SkelterNEWLINE_TOKENMain article: Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor some time, Manson had been saying that racial tension between blacks and whites was growing and that blacks would soon rise up in rebellion in America's cities.[29][30] He had emphasized Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, which had taken place on April 4, 1968.[23] On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at Myers Ranch, the Family members, gathered outside around a large fire, listened as Manson explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had supposedly also been predicted by the Beatles.[26] The White Album songs, he allegedly declared, told it all, although in code. Furthermore, it was said he maintained (or would soon maintain), the album was directed at the Family itself, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster.[29][30]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor L.A.'s supposed tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in Canoga Park, not far from the Spahn Ranch.[2]:244–247[26][31] Because this locale would allow the group to remain ``submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world,``[2]:244–247[32] Manson called it the Yellow Submarine, another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse,[33][34] which, around the campfire, Manson had allegedly termed ``Helter Skelter,`` after the song of that name.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy February, the so-called ``Helter Skelter`` vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. This is just a theory however and many have viewed the album differently. Supposedly, ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in ``the bottomless pit``—a secret city beneath Death Valley.[35] At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told Terry Melcher was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place; but Melcher never arrived.[29][33]}NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN{Crowe shootingNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, on which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit; but he himself did not record the group.[2]:156,185[36]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy June, Manson was allegedly telling the Family they might have to show blacks how to start ``Helter Skelter``.[2]:244–247[34][37] When Manson supposedly tasked Watson with obtaining money supposedly intended to help the Family prepare for the conflict, Watson defrauded a black drug dealer named Bernard ``Lotsapoppa`` Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. Manson countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at his Hollywood apartment.[2]:99–113[2]:91–96[38][39]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENManson's mistaken belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles.

Many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information. Some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all.  This is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with Agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information. You consistently use the book The Singular History of the Golf Tee by Irwin R. Valenta, along with the website “Scottish Golf History” as a fact-based source. Looking at the website alone I find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents. One just for example, is the U.S. patent of Mr. Dalziel in 1896. This patent, is claimed on the site as a “golf tee,” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of Tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf.  See patent #567,455 This is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided.  Another example of a site that has inaccurate information is Pat Ryan Golf timeline. It states that the Bloxsom & Douglas patent originated in 1899. Whether these “inaccuracies” are intentional or not, it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue.  Once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate, upon the notification to the necessary parties, the erroneous information should be removed.  If it is not, then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of the U.S. patents can be verified through the U.S. Patent office website. However, you say that the UK office has patents that are unsearchable through their website.

In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing.

While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process isNEWLINE_TOKEN*The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.NEWLINE_TOKENWhile the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Any war could and should be categorised as an ``atrocity`` but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....NEWLINE_TOKENUnverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.NEWLINE_TOKEN*...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.NEWLINE_TOKENWhile it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.NEWLINE_TOKENDirectly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

But you cannot mention this without also pointing out that this was in large because Communist parties made it the established view in the states they governed.

Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to make the membership list easy to maintain, we happen to have created some artificial criteria for the active list and although you certainly contribute a lot to Wikipedia in general, at the time, I couldn't find any participation in Oregon-related articles. In the interests of ease of maintenance of the list (most people show no interest in such a thankless task and have no opinion about how it is managed), I never bothered to inform folks when they had been moved, but that was probably a mistake. Needless to say, you are a very active Oregon Wikipedian, especially in the area of the WikiWednesday group and the legislative stuff, and that certainly counts for a lot. I've taken the liberty of moving your name back into the active participants list, but feel free to change that if you're not comfortable.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Quality of images===NEWLINE_TOKENThis one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Selection of images===NEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Size and placement of images===NEWLINE_TOKENThere has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views:NEWLINE_TOKEN*Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc.NEWLINE_TOKEN*I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate.NEWLINE_TOKEN*The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on ``zoom in`` or have software that zooms in for all apps.NEWLINE_TOKEN* makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles.NEWLINE_TOKEN*IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a ``one size fits all`` solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four-decade naval career byNEWLINE_TOKENattending and receiving a commission from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1938. In 1970, he wasNEWLINE_TOKENhead of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command.NEWLINE_TOKEN.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHis thirty-six year career in the Navy spanned an era that began on the eve of World WarNEWLINE_TOKENII and lasted into the seventies.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHe was decorated for distinguished performance as Chief Engineer of a carrier during theNEWLINE_TOKENKorean War. Later assignments in the Bureau of Ships included that of Director of ShipNEWLINE_TOKENDesign. After selection to Flag rank, he was chosen as one of the Navy's first ProjectNEWLINE_TOKENManagers. This project led the design of the Fast Deployment Logistics ship, whichNEWLINE_TOKENportended today's Rapid Deployment Force. In its design, Admiral Sonenshein successfullyNEWLINE_TOKENpioneered a new approach which quantified for the first time, top level missionNEWLINE_TOKENrequirements and translated them into ship design parameters to achieve the optimumNEWLINE_TOKENfunctional performance.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the peak of hostilities in Southeast Asia, a period marked by tremendous strain onNEWLINE_TOKENmaterial, personnel and time resources, Admiral Sonenshein was selected to be Commander,NEWLINE_TOKENNaval Ship Systems Command.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga,NEWLINE_TOKENCalifornia less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global MarineNEWLINE_TOKENDevelopment, Inc., in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American SocietyNEWLINE_TOKENof Naval Engineers' Harold E. Saunders Award, which honors ``an individual whose reputationNEWLINE_TOKENin naval engineering spans a long career of notable achievement and influence.`` In 1983,NEWLINE_TOKENhe was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical SystemsNEWLINE_TOKENof the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report,NEWLINE_TOKEN``Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one ofNEWLINE_TOKENeight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The ReaganNEWLINE_TOKENAdministration's choices for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists,NEWLINE_TOKENwho noted that it included no atmospheric scientists.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U.S.NEWLINE_TOKENshipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by governmentNEWLINE_TOKENsubsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyardNEWLINE_TOKENcapacity is ``considerably greater`` than would be required in a major conventional war.NEWLINE_TOKENUsing classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expandNEWLINE_TOKENproduction by 3 1/2 to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. ``LookNEWLINE_TOKENat England in the Falklands``, Sonenshein told the Washington Post. ``In less than twoNEWLINE_TOKENmonths, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that wereNEWLINE_TOKENthen used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and moreNEWLINE_TOKENmerchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you going toNEWLINE_TOKENpay for it? I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have.`` [1]NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSonenshein died at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, California, aged 85.

48685998.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::  is correct as regards changing one's name.  As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: ``Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.``  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).  As an aside - I queried Eamon O Cuiv's use of the letter 'V' in his surname on his article's talk page, and someone pointed out he conveniently drops the 'O' from 'O Cuiv' for listing on ballot papers...  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit ``1``) being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.   So the inter-digit pause is comprise of BOTH the last part of the return movement of the dial and the time taken to ``wind it up`` ready for the next digit.  In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.

259562376.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN==on the Creator==NEWLINE_TOKEN:The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from ``something``. Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   NEWLINE_TOKENOrthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the ``concept of God`` uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.NEWLINE_TOKEN  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIncorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the ``puppet state`` tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that ``he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2``. Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. ``Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2`` This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

NEWLINE_TOKENThe extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, ``effective`` rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhy the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael.

On the note of safety procedure, my friend managed to get a 'sun burn' from the high intensity light.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Electrode ``Cleaning``,==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENis commonly performed by grinding (shaping) the tungsten electrode into a fine, burr-less 'pencil point', using a high speed diamond abrasive wheel. The shape, and angle acuteness of the point, also plays a role in the 'focused' shape of the plasma arc.  The DC arc largely applicable to ferrous metals, benefits from using 2% thoriated tungsten (or 2% ceriated tungsten, an alternative to the radiological concerns of Thorium), while nonferrous metals such as aluminum and magnesium requiring AC current, are performed best with pure tungsten allowing the tip to melt into an enlarged balled surface at the end of the electrode.  A ``ball-point`` subsequently flares the arc onto a much broader surface of the material, where greater expansion and distortion must then be accommodated, or anticipated as part of the welders job.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==More Cleaning==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere's cleaning or shaping of the electrode, and then there's cleaning or ``preparation`` of the work-piece to be welded:  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs you say, dirt, oil and scale are simply removed from parts for a good weld.  Washing, degreasing, rinsing etc, but mechanical abrasion is fast, easy and most popular as shaping a weld chamfer can be done simultaneous to ``cleaning``.   AlumaPrep (or some brand name like that), is simply an acid rinse to remove stubborn anodizing and any last marks of finger print oil from the 'touchy' AC needing metals.  But as Triddle pointed out in his explanation of +/- wave form capable machines, the plasma itself will often do a fine job of burning off simple surface impurities.  Deep inclusions (ubiquitous in sand casted work) are a frustration all unto themselves.  Welder (the person) tolerance, patience, and experience must often judge what level of weld quality exist after cooling.  High-tech work, demands that the work piece billet is good stuff to begin with, yet there is a variety of filler rod that can be used to accommodate persnickety base material.  Nickle, Bronze and ``Everdure`` (brand name) are often blended into filler rods, and greatly assist the welder trying to fix cracked engine blocks or other sandy and oil impregnated work pieces.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENReactor vessels of all types, be they nuclear or cellular, are also a field unto themselves.  As the physical strength of a finished weld may really be the lesser of engineering concerns.  Chemistry plays a role in both questions of what will actually be held in the vessel, and how it may be cleaned between use.  Low carbon 316 SS (316L) commonly desired for biomedical applications where autoclaving and bleach will still kick the ass out of Stainless Steel.  Titanium and its many grades are like wise a subject for deep thought, but once the decision is made...  it works like soft butter, and few other welds can look so nice raw.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==As to the safety stuff.==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA hot horse shoe is hot, and most animals with any brain will let go of it before they get burned too bad.  Therefor, direct and immediate sensible surface heat, is far less of real danger than the intense UV of the plasma arch as Gaiusjuliuscesar talked about 'sun burn', often called ``flash burn``.  Fully covering any skin, just as one might wish to reduce sun burn.  It's the same stuff.  Welders, responsible ones, will even clear a room of bystanders, even ones who ``know not to look into the light with out a hood``.  Side vision (looking off to one side) doesn't work either, as the cornea and retina damage (not dependent on center of focused vision) is extremely painful when experienced, (ya, I know) and not felt for many hours after excessive exposure.  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

497382776.0,"SDATA_6 :  NEWLINE_TOKENThis is an excellent question (though, perhaps, not in the right forum). While I agree that the vast majority of tenured academics are not notable (at most schools, tenure is not really that hard), there is the question of top notch professors who are respected by their communities but don't make it into the popular press. Should we have a different notability criterion for them? My feeling is that there is no hurry. If a professor is significant in his or her community, they'll sooner or later get a chair at their, presumably well known, university and that, for us, is a sufficient condition for inclusion. As with everything else, we need some reliable indicator of notability and these indicators exist in academia so we shouldn't get into the business of trying to determine notability ourselves.      : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

It bases its observations, which IMHO verge at the very least on Original research, on how a particular country implements its digital TV system. For example, GeorgeFormby1 misses a great deal of context about the British situation which is relevant here, such as:NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::* Digital TV in the UK is strongly influenced by Freeview (and its soon to be launched sister Freesat), which are subscription free digital TV systems that the BBC (the UK's very dominant (compared to the US) public broadcaster is the key stakeholder in.  As pointed out by , Freeview boxes now retail at around £20 (actually around $40).  Although, it may seem a lot to pensioners in the US it is small compared to the annual, compulsory, Television licence fee of around £130per year ($260).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::* Europe has traditionally had a much stronger regulatory framework with regards to broadcasting.  Where as, (if i understand correctly) in the US, cities are well served and rural areas often poorly served (in some cases having to pay to have affiliates and stations from other markets relayed to them so they can actually have a TV service at all), most of the traditional ``analogue`` channels in the UK and Europe(in the UK: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, C4 and to a slighlty lesser extent Five, whose availability is constrained by the amount of bandwidth that was left in Europe by the time it started in 1997)  are obliged as part of their licence to be available universally i.e. In the UK, >98% coverage of the UK landmass.  This means that European airwaves tend to be very crowded and together with the stronger licensing rules means that there are relatively few analogue channels (UK homes get 4 or 5 channels, and 6 in a *small* number of cities, where (usually) community groups are given a *low* power licence.)NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::* The above therefore identifies the reason why a lot of European countries had an appetite for more channels when digital TV came along.  The restricted space available, particularly terrestrially, has meant that channels tend to be crammed into the available space, and indeed some digital channels have a very poor picture quality compared to a good analogue signal.  But this only tells half the story, implementations vary even in one country, for example in the UK compare the bit-rates of BBC1 digital are at about ~6Mbps compared to those on Mux A which run at <2Mbps (e.g. Five Life et al).  Thus, the resultant picture quality is purely down to the implementation,  that various multiplex owners have chosen to take and is not indicative of digital TV in general.  Indeed, as I understand in the US, where homes generally have a much greater number of channels but are ``afflicted`` with the inferior NTSC system.  The application of digital TV has generally been to deliver HDTV as opposed to large quantities of new channels...NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::::... and indeed that brings the question of what it is all for! In the UK and Europe large swathes of digital space are reserved for the public broadcasters (without getting into a debate over whether all this space is used for programming that is truely public service), post digital switch-over this will allow every home in the UK to access free-to-air and  terrestrially (the way most people receive TV in the UK) channels such as BBC Parliament (coverage of parliament), BBC News 24 (likely to be the UK's only free-to-air rolling news channel before long), BBC Four (``high brow`` arts and culture), Teachers TV (a channel for Teachers), etc, etc,.

Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. NEWLINE_TOKEN:The main idea for chapter two, Nonverbal communication: its origins and development, is the awareness of events around the child such as gaze and gesture interaction, facial expressions, and modifying emotional expressiveness. ``With age, children's encoding (sending messages) and decoding (interpreting messages) skills increase. Yet children are better at decoding than at encoding, a fact suggesting that nonverbal comprehension precedes production`` (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 35). This fact represents interpersonal communication and how it improves with age in children. NEWLINE_TOKEN:The main point for chapter three, The development of language, is the social development based on the environment of the child. ``Children's nonverbal communication skills, especially those developed through interactional synchrony with adult caretakers, foreshadow the conversational exchanges that typify interpersonal communication.`` (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 57) Good interpersonal communication starts from the beginning with infant communication, mainly nonverbal, and so it translates to the developmental skills to attain high levels of communication. This chapter also touches on stages in language development which is a slight alternative idea to explain parts of interpersonal developmental process. The stages include prelinguistic development, speech perception/production, semantic development, private speech, and first words. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Also, the main idea for chapter four, Developing verbal communication and how its relevant in children's acquisition of a variety of communicative strategies for attaining goals. A main focus is ``discussing the communicative intentionally substage of development`` for infants ``emerging abilities to control their communicative skills`` (Haslett, B. B., & Samter, W., 1997, p. 105). All three chapters contribute to a more concise understanding of language how it contributes to the ideas of interpersonal communication development in young children.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

Well, I'm a Wikipedia:Administrator, which means that, apart from the usual work of editing and writing articles I can do a few additional things associated with trying to keep the place running smoothly and cleaning up when it runs less smoothly. So I can (un)delete articles, (un)block account, (un)protect pages and edit protected pages within strict limits. That's all, though. Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work. Generally, the community does not grant adminship to users with less than 3 months of good contribution across a reasonably broad spectrum of activity. After all, if you're going to have the ability to help look after the place, you need to be well-familiar with how it normally looks and works. So you need to show that your responsible and trustworthy, civil when in conflict and that you have a good grasp of the various policies, guidelines and common practises. There's a lot of advice in WP:GRFA which you can look through. You can also read through the current nominations on WP:RFA and see the reasons people give for supporting and opposing requests.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou may find that your time on Wikipedia is entirely fulfilling without the additional admin tools — after all, you don't need any of them to actually write the encyclopedia. - NEWLINE_TOKEN:Old successful nominations are held in Wikipedia:Recently created admins and old unsuccessful nominations in Wikipedia:Unsuccessful adminship candidacies.

I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own.

The idea the author made up the band, and therefore the interview, is exceedingly unlikely. ¶ The other source should obviously have been removed regardless of it's reliability, since it seemed to be primarily about a charity cooking event and didn't match the point it was supposed to illustrate.   `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

On the subject of Aristotle's De Mundo, there are two points that should be made.

The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many ``introductions`` to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as ``In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts``.

You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs``: that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, ``source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs`` is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google ``Fogerty bootleg``, though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?).

You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: ``despite the truth of what you were inserting``. Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is ``the truth``. That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call ``the truth``.

In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in Women’s Health History.

Wade trial.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today.

76465173.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::Lordkazan, I am currently looking for suitable citations. But still, I feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally ``biased`` ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word ``intact``, which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

521796710.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Hello, Wood Dickinson. I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as ``Article that has no meaningful, substantive content``. Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was ``Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference`` followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I ``don't see any value`` in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have ``placeholder`` articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect ``we haven't written this page yet, but we will`` does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a ``userspace`` page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called , and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I give up quite a significant amount of my time to Wikipedia administration. Unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism, trivia, propaganda, uninformed adolescent speculation, illegal content, and other unhelpful stuff. If there weren't people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess, Wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. You are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wikipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to help implement those policies, but I disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as ``trolling``.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I hope these comments will be helpful to you. If you have any further questions about these matters, please feel welcome to contact me here again.

Unsourced promotion of opinions, as well as the original synthesis (novel interpretation) of published material, violates Wikipedia's policies of neutrality, due-weight, and no original research. Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. ``Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics``) the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.  The facts themselves are certainly appropriate in each species' article, but combining them in a novel fashion to reach a conclusion(?) unsupported by sources is synthesis.  If you're concerned that interesting behavior or anatomy is not being highlighted, you might expand coverage in relevant sections of Fish locomotion or Diversity of fish. It's fine to say something like ``the Zob fish ventures onto land``, or even ``The Zob fish is a classic, textbook example of a tetrapod-like fish (Smith, 1980),``  but it would be synthesis and non-neutral to say (or imply) ``The Zob fish interestingly resembles tetrapods because it ventures onto land`` without any citation.   `  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1

The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.

To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTo wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2011:  -$212,214NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2012:  -$869,686NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2013: -$1,156,765NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2014:  -$1,130,680NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHow in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENChecking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDid anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBest of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor tillNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTHIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENJustify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* * *NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSource: Watching the WatchdogsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSHARE VIA EMAIL OR SOCIAL MEDIA:NEWLINE_TOKENEmail this to someoneShare on FacebookTweet about this on TwitterShare on Google+Share on TumblrShare on VKShare on RedditPrint this pageNEWLINE_TOKENRelated Articles:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNew Study: SPLC is a FraudNEWLINE_TOKENWho’s a White Supremacist?NEWLINE_TOKENThe SPLC — A Deadly Double StandardNEWLINE_TOKENSPLC: The Quotable Mr. PotokNEWLINE_TOKENSPLC Insinuates Itself into Department of Homeland SecurityNEWLINE_TOKEN REPORTS    MORRIS DEES, SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER, SPLC  : EDATA_6",test,-1,-1
57143386.0,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Chile==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCielo Estrellado please please do not support Al Andalus on this. The word Mestizo is never used in the hispanic world to describe people who are predominantly European as is the case for most Chileans. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Firstly, as you may know, in Latin America it is used for those who are predominantly amerindian in their ancestry. (It would apply in Mexico and Central America). NEWLINE_TOKEN*Secondly, there is no defined ethnic group in Chile which can be defined as mestizo, there are just people with more or less Indian bood, Spanish origin being nearly always the larger part of the ancestry. There is no sense of common belonging shared exclusively by people with amerindian ancestry which excludes people who dont have this ancestry. This is a vital characteristic of an ethnic group.NEWLINE_TOKEN*The word mestizo is pejorative in our language and should be used as little as possible. Ill give you an example. When the movie ``Harry Potter and the half-blood prince`` came out in the Spanish speaking world, it was translated into Harry Potter and the Prince, because of the negative connotations that the word mestizo implied.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Finally, in our cultural community, Latinness, Spanishness (or if you want to use racial terms ``whiteness``) is an expansive concept which does not exclude people placind then in a different ethnic group on the basis of their blood being ``tainted`` as happens in the Anglo Saxon world. Although, I agree that that in certain countries where racial divisions have been stronger due to a much larger Amerindian community, (such as Peru or Guatemala) leading to implications regarding identity and ethnicity..NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyways I hope you understand my position and we can establish some dialogue on this issue which transcends the narrow (and in my opinion racist) perspective of Genetic studies.NEWLINE_TOKENI also hope you are not a sock puppet of user: al andalus!
