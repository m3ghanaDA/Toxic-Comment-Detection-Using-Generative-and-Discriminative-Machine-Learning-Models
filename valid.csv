I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as ``problematic``.  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.NEWLINE_TOKENI hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of ``these commercial products`` is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.

All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).

To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book ``The Real Split In The International`` could just as well be called the ``fundamental split`` if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff.

ZZM is obsessed with the process, and presents endless hurdles to improving the product. He constantly quotes Wikipeida policies to me. If I want to make a change, I am violating WP:XXXX, he tells me every time. I understand there is a Wikipedia policy that says ``ignore all rules`` WP:IAR and another that says, don't be a WP:DICK.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Of course, the one thing ZZM clains over and over is that his right to do whatever he wants, and for me this behavior is very disruptive, is justified by WP:OWN, that I don't own it. He's can't hold off for a few hours when I ask him, so that I can finish something.  Doesn't this violate WP:DICK? But seriously, WP:OWN is just an excuse for endless circular edit wars, because the answer to I don't own it is that he also doesn't own it. But that brings up one more thing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You really need to chill out however, because I am afraid either you will be blocked from editing certain articles (along with ZZM, I would hope) or you will get frustrated and refuse to participate (not very mature if you did that).  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You say, ``not very mature if you did that``? Pardon me, but one thing that I do own is my own life, my own time, and my own abilities. Right now, the article Judaism and evolution is a polished and sourced article from the heading ``Jewish opposition to Darwinian evolution`` on down. Above that heading, the article is a mess of unsourced quotations, mostly. Those quotations are generally correct, and do give a good sense of what mainstream Jewish opinion is on evolution. But turning what is there now (and all the other material that is available) into a real article is going to be a lot of work. Of course, somebody else could do that work, and somebody else will eventually come along who wants to. But am I ``not mature`` if I don't want to? No, my life is my life!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Based on my experience with ZayZayEM, who has followed me from one article into several others already, I don't want to work on it.

It doesn't matter if you can't convey what you mean absolutely accurately, because the layman can then go back and read your original technical sentence and try to piece together what you are saying given the context of the easier sentence.

That is understandable as the subject is complex. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first ``main line`` Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6`` line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939.

I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page.

Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .NEWLINE_TOKENThere is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.NEWLINE_TOKENNewton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.NEWLINE_TOKENWhat is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.NEWLINE_TOKENThe radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu  : EDATA_6",dev,0

The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams.

I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found ``the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as ``removing edits [you] just don't like`` and as a ``simple/simplistic knee-jerk response``.`` Which seems justified.

In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums.

259871887,"SDATA_6 :  `In mathematics, an ordinal number, or just ordinal, is a transitive set of ordinals, or hereditarily transitive set.  That is, every element of an ordinal is transitive and its elements in turn are transitive and so on down.  The Axiom of regularity stops this recursion after finitely many steps, namely at the empty set.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe finite ordinals are 0 = {}, 1 = {0}, 2 = {0,1}, 3 = {0,1,2}, ….  This is a consequence of two remarkable facts, that every element of a finite transitive set is itself a finite transitive set (so we can drop ``ordinal`` as a condition for membership in a finite ordinal), and only one set of each finite cardinality can be transitive, whence the finite ordinals can be identified with their cardinalities as per the foregoing enumeration.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is evident for the finite ordinals that the successor of an ordinal α is α∪{α}.  In fact this holds for all ordinals.  We write α∪{α} as α+1.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe set of all finite ordinals is transitive and hence itself an ordinal.  It is the least infinite ordinal, and is denoted ω.  It is the canonical example of a countable set, and its cardinality is denoted .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLike the finite ordinals, ω has a successor ω+1, namely {0,1,2,…,ω}.  That in turn has a successor {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1}, and we can continue in this way until we reach {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1,ω+2…} = ω+ω, denoted ω·2.  Continuing faster we eventually reach ω·2+ω = ω·3.  We could consider ω·3+1, but moving yet faster we arrive at ω·4, ω·5, and eventually ω·ω, denoted ω2.  Picking up yet more speed, we arrive at ω3, ω4, … and then ωω.  Getting into high gear we speed past ωω, ωωω, ωωωω, …, to arrive at ε0, the least ordinal α satisfying α = ωα.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThroughout this entire sequence, every ordinal has been countable, that is, its cardinality has been .  However one cannot infer from this that every countable ordinal is ω.  To see this, consider listing all infinitely many even numbers first, and then continue by listing the odd numbers.  Then 1 is preceded only by even numbers, but there is no even number immediately before 1 because there is no largest even number.  So unlike the usual enumeration of the natural numbers, in which every number but 0 has a predecessor, this enumeration is structurally different, that is, it is not order isomorphic to ω.  Instead it is order isomorphic to ω+ω = ω·2, because the set of even numbers standardly ordered is order isomorphic to ω, and likewise the odd numbers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore we have not come close to exhausting the countable ordinals: ε0+1 is countable, and so on.  To get past the countable ordinals requires a new insight.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKENEvery ordinal is linearly ordered by inclusion, for example 2 < 4 because {0,1} is a subset of {0,1,2,3}.  This linear order is in fact a well-order, that is, every nonempty set of ordinals has a least element.  Hence for every predicate that is not false of all ordinals, there exists a least ordinal satisfying that predicate.  Furthermore no two ordinals are order isomorphic, and every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to some ordinal, whence the ordinals can serve to encode the order types of all well-ordered sets however large.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere exist uncountable ordinals, whence by the foregoing there exists a least uncountable ordinal, denoted ω1.  The cardinality of this ordinal is denoted , which is the next cardinal after .  There is a sequence of increasingly large ordinals as measured by their cardinality, denoted ω1, ω2, ω3, …, with corresponding cardinalities , , , ….  The cardinality of an ordinal defines a many to one association from ordinals to cardinals, with all ordinals between ωi inclusive and ωi+1 exclusive having the same cardinality .`  : EDATA_6",dev,0

Remember that you are describing a work of fiction, not telling a story. Also the style is repetitive and boring. Let me pick apart a paragraph - NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe missions (what is meant by ``mission``?) in Jak 3 are generally either platform-based(platforming) or driving-based. The platform segments involve Jak(``the player``, Jak is a rendered model, someone else is doing the jumping. ``Jak`` is ok for story elements, but gameplay is about the player) jumping from platform to platform (that is what platforming means, right?) battling creatures along the way (he battles in both types of missions, right?). For these segments, he is also provided a rifle (does someone give him a rifle at the beginning of each segment?), the functionality of which changes with the kind of ammunition being used (how so?, also maybe ``changes depending on the ammunition used``). The car driving (``driving``, ``car`` is implied) segments (segmentsX2) usually involve Jak racing against time (prose, try ``have specific time constraints``) to complete a mission (that is what one does with missions), while defending himself against other cars (cars attack people?) or giant Metal Heads (?). When not on a mission (missionX3), Jak wanders the streets of either Spargus or Haven City (prose, and what reason do we have to care which fictional city he is wandering in?), searching for someone to assign him a mission (this sentence makes him sound so lame).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'd do an edit myself, but I know nothing of Jak, and as it is this article does not make me care to. ~  `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCanof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as ``steroids`` by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==removed section and reasons==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.NEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.NEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea  : EDATA_6",dev,0

However, your handling of my edit to Woody Allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy.  I will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin, such as myself.  I now understand your point about the first sentence.  I just went out and found a reliable source for Ronan's comment in the second sentence.  Ronan's comment is notable (in hundred's of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both Allen and Farrow).  I understand that I should not have put back in the first sentence, but on the other hand your edit was wrong.  Yes, I know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make Wikipedia work better (and I'm sure that Jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make Wikipedia better).  You should have only removed the first sentence (because it was not supported by a RS) which is how it ultimately turned out.  However, for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article, including the direct comment of Ronan Farrow, Allen's only biological child.  That was heavy-handed editing.  The quote is notable.  Yes, it was initially placed in the article, by another editor, with the support of a non-RS; however, it is all over the Internet.  It is quoted by literally hundreds of RS's and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a RS to replace the non-reliable source.  That would have been the correct way to handle the situation.  I hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future.  I fully expect to hear from you I'm just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative, but I do expect to hear from you.

Looking at it now, I see that ``The Beatles Discography`` is without images, although the main article still contains music samples.  Does minimal use mean ``No use``?

First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section).

For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.   `  : EDATA_6",dev,1

In actuality, it is the ``firearm experts`` that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.

I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.

So it is somewhat safe to conclude that Mahavatar Babaji was a ``normal`` human being intermingling with people in civilization, though probably exaggerated thru time. So, what we need here is a book published before Autobiography of a Yogi saying that the Baba of Hariakhan is Lahiri Mahasaya's guru? What if I can provide that?

256962588,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Narciso Yepes's Revolutionary Technical Developments ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is a story that has been recounted numerous times by Yepes and by his students: ``You know, the guitar is a very unusual instrument, for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar, someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar, someone who's genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a ``musical scale.`` I played a standard guitar scale using alternating ``i`` and ``m`` fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a ``musical scale`` on several other orchestral instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, ``Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm.`` Well, I had two choices. One was to be the ``genuis of the guitar,`` to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for ``the door was open`` for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam), and the next week, I was able to play a ``musical scale.`` He smiled, and told me that I did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou may also wish to look up Yepes's three-fingered scales/trills techniques NEWLINE_TOKEN(www.blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=145762269&blogID;=376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented.

Local government is pretty big in California, and there is no mention of special districts anywhere in the article. Third, capital punishment is given more detail than any branch of the government.

We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess`` (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much ``gain`` they would have gotten from a ``less than optimum`` (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier`` or 'feeble and unintelligible`` communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn't see any need to bite someone's head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people's comments.

Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.

Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.

I would also note that I question the data somewhat because Rich Farmbrough did a lot of edits himself prior to being banned from automation so I find it hard to believe that there was only a modest drop. I doubt that the remaining editors did enough edits to offset that loss and certainly counting bot edits we are missing out on a lot. With that said, the corps Wikipedia site seems to be operating progressively slower with each new release so that IMO is at least part of the reason for the decline. Also, the tabs tend to jump around a lot on slow connections so editors not familiar with the site get turned off rather quickly by have to play chase the wild button around.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Fighting Campaign Battles ==  TAB_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENDuring the campaign the player has the option of forming armies to defend their borders, wage war and destroy rebel armies that appear occasionaly. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is already covered under the second paragraph of the Gameplay section, specifically: ``The campaign allows the player to assume control of a faction of the time period, and build a civilization, economy and military in order to conquer other factions. Gameplay consists of controlling the faction's military, economic, and social systems via a large campaign map. During the player's turn, armies, fleets, and agents can be moved on the map. When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENArmies are formed from 'Units' normally consisted of 20-30 men for artillery, 30-40 men for cavalry and 60-70 men for infantry or archers. In adition to this a general can also recruit mercenaries for a price if need be. An army can consist of up to twenty units, or as little as one, and will move according to the units it contains. This means that an army consisting entirely of cavalry can cover a lot of ground in one turn, but would be able to cover a much shorter distance were the army to have any artillery or infantry units. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI feel that this falls under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information specifically section 4, Instruction Manuals. The specific number of people in a unit isn't significant except in the context of the game, nor are unit speed, the ability to recruit mercenaries and army size limits (since they are artificial limits established by the game designers.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA general can be selected from amongst your family to lead the army, and he will benefit or hinder the army based on his personal traits, a General who starts fighting when he is young is more likely to develop a keen skill for combat that one who has spent most of his life governing a city. The risk is that should the army be beaten then the General may die, and even during a battle that is going in your favour your general can still get cut off, surrounded by the enemy or hit by a stray arrow. Losing a general can bring an end to a generation if he were the only son without an heir, which can affect your whole family tree for generations. An army without a general is lead by a captain, who will fight alongside whichever unit you select as the first unit in your army. A captain who performs well in battle may be promoted to General, and be adopted into your family. These generals are generally better suited to combat rather than Govenment roles.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGenerals are already covered under Agents and Characters: ``In addition to their agents, each faction is ruled by a family, the male members of which act as generals in battle. Each general has a number of attributes which determine how well he governs a settlement and how well he leads an army in battle. A general's actions can affect his attributes- for example, a general who routinely kills prisoners of war may see his ``dread`` increase, making him frightening to foes; a general who prefers to release prisoners may instead increase his ``chivalry``, which makes his own troops braver.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen two armies meet they can engage in combat, which can be either automatically resolved by the computer or fought by the the player.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlready covered at the end of the second paragraph of Gameplay: ``When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN''Armies can meet in several ways: two armies meet on an area of open ground face to face and resolve their differences, an army can wait in a wooded area and surprise a passing enemy army, an army can lay seige to a town or castle and fight the garrison for control. Training and forming a working army is an expensive and lengthly process, and traveling to fight the enemy can take even longer, so the aim of every Battle during the campaign is to kill or capture as many of the enemy as possible, while minimizing the loss to your own army, thus allowing you to carry on fighting for longer with the same army.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOther distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAxel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium).

The fact that they are accepted as ``martyrs`` by the Roman church does not make them ``martyrs`` in the Orthodox or even the Protestant sense. So, since the meager content of this stub is mostly about the Roman Catholic individuals who were cannonized, it is appropriate to divide things and qualify things as I had done.

Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth.

If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the ``explanation`` of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make ``heads and tails`` of.

I can agree that ``homophobic`` might be misleading, as there's no evidence I can cite that proves he's actually AFRAID of gay people.  However, there is mountains of evidence that he is against gays in general, the gay movement, the gay agenda, whatever.  Let's face facts (not opinions, not passive observations, but facts).  The man hasn't walked a step, spoken a word, inhaled or exhaled in the course of recorded history without firing off some quip about how homosexuals are damning the world and what have you.  I think ``anti-homosexual`` is perfectly fitting in the lead paragraph.   had a very good point when he (or she) wrote if someone is famous for something that many consider a negative attribute, we still have to indicate that. NPOV =/= hagiography.  An example of this (and this is what I mean by this being brought up before) is the article for Adolf Hitler.  The same condition applies here.  Inarguably, he is ``famous for something that many consider a negative attribute``.  The majority of people probably don't hold the guy to very high standards for his involvement with the Nazi party.  Yet, this bit of information is listed in the lead sentence of his article.

They could use their free time to sell produce in the markets, or hire themselves out as laborers, nurses, craftsmen or artisans.

310364999,"SDATA_6 :  `This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes ``But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create.`` Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only ``some few things!``  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want `` society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.``  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that ``only psychologists know psychology`` as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It's as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects ``encyclopedic.`` A ``democratic sense of equality`` brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (``why shouldn't everybody be able to practice medicine? let's leak all the questions ans answers...``), etc.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it's much harder for this to be done if he can't use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas' statement that ``is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful`` is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach's main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests' ``cheat sheet`` (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test's questions and answers.      NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They're just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It's rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the ``dark ages`` by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when ``common sense`` indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but ``common sense`` tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of ``magic`` is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).  : EDATA_6",dev,0

I had noticed over the years that the errors and loss of detail were compounding concerning the reported events surrounding Symbolics, Inc.  As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRichard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough I have not laid hands on the documentation for this event within the last two decades, I believe that my copies are still in my possession and the Dave Andre, John Kulp and Patrick Winston can verify the details cited above.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRussell NoftskerNEWLINE_TOKENCo-Founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Symbolics, Inc.  : EDATA_6",dev,1

You've basically used this article to ballwash his lousy book that is in fact another stepping stone in the falsification of a misunderstood sub-genre of hardcore music that was born with the worst name in the history of genre titles. If you're not him, then I hope he's paid you well to pimp his nam here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou know why these things are so little known? Because the people that know about it, that care about it, aren't writing for Rolling Stone/Spin or sharing their thoughts on some famous blog or anything like that. Where are these so-called reputable sources? I don't need some celebrity gossip site telling me a band is emo-pop (what?) and having this site link to that as if it's factually correct. I see a solid 9 links to the Billboard charts, all for completely off-topic, non-emo related material. I must say the standard set for good sources here is criminally low.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNone of this is my point of view, because I am simply talking about facts and events that really happened. Yes those bands were real in the 90's, and yes they played what is really emo. Then the mainstream caught ahold of it and ruined it by plugging bands like SDRE and Weezer that had nothing to do with it. That's what really happened. Why would there not be countless tales of this happening? Because the mainstream media, the only people that can put out articles in the mid-90's before the internet buzz, never heard of the damn word until those kind of popular bands started having it associated with their name. ``Oh emo, that must be emotional right? And listen to this band. They don't sound like anything else out there today. Emo it is!`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou think I'm an elitist, but I'm just being a realist.

As mentioned above, he claimed that the Italian unification gave Italy a king, not a president. I proved to him that the unification gave Italy both. He further claimed that Spain ruled Naples, Sicily and Sardinia during Columbus's time, and he sent me about five Wikipedia articles that he said would prove it. (And called me ignorant!) I did not care to look at his articles, as he might have changed them deliberately for his own self-serving needs. So, instead, I went to Wikipedia's ``Italian Renaissance`` article, and I found it stated that during the Middle Ages (1300-1499), Naples, Sicily and Sadinia were ruled by the Arabs and the Normans. This seemed more on the right track to me. On Monday, I borrowed a book about the Italian Rennaisance from my local library. In truth, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were governed mostly by the Arabs and the Normans during this time. Spain was involed in it with the Normans. The Norman kings and queens were marrying Spanish kings and queens, in these parts of Italy, and future rulers included second and third generation nobles who were born on the Italian peninsula. All said, Spain had a bit to do with these parts of Italy at that time. It's generally accepted that the lion's share of it all belongs to the Arabs and the Normans. SamEV's gross exaggeration about Spain ruling these areas, at that time, is a sad reminder that people who edit on Wikipedia are not always using the exact truth. Now, regarding SamEV's attacks. I was raised, in what I believe, is the correct way. The majority of people agree, that calling someone ``ignorant`` is offensive and insulting. (Dictionaries often point this out.) Unfortunately, there exists a minority of people, who, with mean-spirited intention, will call people such names, and, then, hide behind a false angelic face of well-meant wisdom. I don't buy this type of mentality! SamEV, says above that ``it's no crime to be ignorant``. Well, he, himself, was ignorant when it came to some Italian matters on this website. I wonder how long it takes to become a ``rookie``, like SamEV, himself, on Wikipedia. Pertaining to the vernacular...I'm not interested in slang (or attempts to verify it)! In the future, I, like many people, will prefer to go to the library and search for a good book on the topic I happen to be interested in. This website has that ``too many cooks spoiling the soup`` feel to it, and in most cases, the articles are not accurrate. The librarian, I spoke to on Monday, had this to say: ``Oh, Wikipedia?

400264699,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENMy view on this is probably similar (but probably not identical) to Cirt's. Speaking for myself, I have two problems with the use of ``Calvinist`` on this basis: (i) there are multiple ways that calling a website 'The Calvinist Corner'  the most obvious is that Slick is writing from a Calvinist perspective. Another might be that he is writing about Calvinism. To take the former as true, and draw the the conclusion that Slick is a Calvinist is an inference and thus WP:Synthesis. It's most probably true, but not the sort of thing we're meant to be doing on Wikipedia. (ii) There's a fairly strong Calvinist thread through much (most?) of conservative evangelical Christianity. There are probably dozens of articles where we could find a similar level of evidence for applying the word 'Calvinist'. We don't, and to my mind shouldn't, unless a WP:SECONDARY source feels it sufficiently relevant/important a description to make use of it. This means that such articles aren't 'loaded up' with true-but-of-doubtful-relevance WP:IINFO descriptions. I suspect that part of the problem is that much of the secondary-source writing concentrates on CARM rather than Slick personally. However this simply means that, per WP:DUE, we should follow suit.

The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSeason one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children.

A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Main characters ==NEWLINE_TOKEN* Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is ``Girlpants``, but he sometimes calls Lucien a ``nerd``. Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. NEWLINE_TOKEN* Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.

Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans.

122971928,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Now I see ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo basically, your plan is to find any single record which disagrees with all other records and that is the one you are going with.  In the case of Mike Sharperson, Social Security records suffice so you change his birth year to 1960 - even though all other sources say 1961.  But, in the case of Larry MacPhail, Social Security records agree with all other sources that his birth year was 1890 so instead you use his draft records - apparently the only source that shows 1888 - and change all references to his birth year to 1888.  Except in the case of MacPhail - as well as Casey Stengel and Chief Bender - his own gravestone disagrees with you (yes, there is a picture here)!  Doesn't that mean that MacPhail faked his date of birth for the draft and not the other way around?!  And Stengel's fake birth certificate was the one that said 1889?  You say Chief Bender's sister found his birth certificate in 1942 and it said he was born in 1883.  Then why did he have 1884 put on his gravestone when he died - 12 years later?!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis tactic of yours gives the appearance that records are only good enough for you when they make you look like the hero investigator - the one who cut through all popular misconceptions and ``found the truth once and for all``.  Social Security records are gospel in one case (Sharperson) but are bunk in others (MacPhail and others).  If you're really writing a book using this tactic - and without pointing out that those dates are the lone exceptions - then you should really be ashamed.  And if your editors and publishing company don't point out the error of your ways, they should likewise be ashamed.  And if you think that research like that is going to be permitted on Wikipedia, then you are mistaken.

467274138,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::::::::That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow ``the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future`` still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like ``the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus`` and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

The idea isn't to exclude information (such as some theories), but to provide as much information as possible (such as adding more theories). WegianWarrior explains it well: ``Wikipedia isn't about whats valid or not, its about what can be verified. It's a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists.`` And Blueboar's statement (``If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory``) is valid and useful in this discussion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUkufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you.

As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the ``good image`` of Germany.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't ``settled``. There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) ``The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike. `` Source: New York Times May 19, 1985.

There will probably be more discussions about this in the future, but let's leave it there for now.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Maybe just some spaced-out thoughts of mine.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: /     : EDATA_6",dev,0

474811572,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== edits in Jan., 2012 ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThank you for recently updating this article. I hope you continue. This article has had many adverse edits in the past and I try to keep it within Wikipedia's standards.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf a statement with two facts is supported by a source and one fact and the source are updated, check whether the source is positioned in the sentence to make it look like the source also supports the other fact. Then be sure the source does support both facts. Otherwise, readers will be misled. If that source does not actually support the second fact, you should find a source for the second fact or preserve the original source and place or edit it so that readers will know which fact is supported by which source. If a fact does not have a source cited for it, the fact can be challenged, edited, or deleted by any editor (the exception being, as Wikipedians sometimes say, that no source is needed for the fact that ``the sky is blue``, or for any fact not likely to be challenged). Much about HSA has been challenged in the past (possibly because of political dislike toward Dr. Moskowitz) and sourcing should be carefully done.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSources should be secondary, meaning at least one level removed from personal experience. Usually, that means an independent third-party reliable source. By contrast, for example, SA's website is a primary source about SA. Self-statements are primary sources. Primary sources are allowed but must be used with greater care and generally should be shunned (except in the External Links section, for example). Try to find secondary sources wherever possible. Part of Wikipedia's standard is at WP:PSTS.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe lede (sometimes spelled ``lead``) should be a summary of the body of the article, so it doesn't get a reference. Because the lede is a summary, any statement in the lede should essentially be in the body, too, so the reference should be positioned where the body's statement is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA tendency to write an article like an advertisement sometimes crops up. The recent edits to this article were mild in that regard; I've seen a much more obvious case recently in another article. While this school network has remarkable achievements that should be described, legitimately sourced criticisms also have to be included or preserved. Articles that are too much like ads are subject to severe rewritings or reversions to earlier revisions, often by editors less familiar with the subject.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRef elements generally follow punctuation. For example, we'd write, ``This is a fact,Source A. and this is another fact.Source B.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENImages need alt texts, so that people who are blind or visually impaired can have their browsers read aloud information about a picture.

In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDavid Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising ``scam`` (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUsing the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976.

The historic common language of the Lowands however was Northern English - from the 7th century onwards brought by the Anglo-Saxons who arrived in Caledonia at almost exactly the same time as the Scots. It continued to be called English (often spelled Inglis and other variants) until the very end of the 15th century when some Scots, correctly or incorrectly,  began calling their northern variant(s) of English 'Scots'. They had previously called Gaelic 'Scots'. Scots-English (in addition to Scots) was certainly commonplace by the Act of Union in 1707 - and indeed was already commonplace by the time of the King James bible in 1611. Historic spelling sometimes gives a quite false impression of difference, but there was no real standard spelling anywhere in Britain, in England or Scotland, until the 18th century.

Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the ``purohit `` of the temple who also happens to be our ``purohit`` (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word ``purohit`` in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the ``kul devta`` temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called ``Bhairav`` and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted ``Shrestha`` (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons.

Like I said history has to be written as it is . I personally come from a family where my forefathers served as general and strategists for Shah Dyansty , my Great grand father was the first person to open a soda factory in Nepal ( even King Mahendra was astonished that we could make soda in Nepal) he also did a lot of things but am not here to publicize my family .

Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing ``Brew Like A Monk``, writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad ``specialized`` belgian ales.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great. (Indeed, I would appriciate it if those that object would show me where the BJCP contradicts the opinions of other groups on these subjects.)`  : EDATA_6",dev,0

Merriam-Webster even now defines pescetarianism  as ``vegetarians who eat fish`` (as I've already mentioned)...so, clearly, there is validity in mentioning pescetarianism as being an aspect of vegetarianism (as much as veganism is), especially as long we note the dispute between the two terms, and especially when pescetarianism is present within the body of this article, below the lead.   `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

Read Hammond: ``An interesting feature of this culture is that it has been found only to the north of the Shkumbi valley; that is it is concentrated within the cantons of Mirdite and Mati (between Shtish-Tufina near Tirana and Dalmace in the north), and that it has outlying pockets at the north end of Lake Ochrid, at Golaj in Albanian Kosove, and at Mijele at the northern end of Lake Scodra. Thus the ambit of this culture is precisely in the region which we have identified on literary grounds as that of 'Arbana' and 'Albeigne'. The conclusion seems to be clear that the people of this region - known no doubt as Arbanoi and Albanoi - developed in this mountainous terrain, with many peaks of five and six thousand feet, a culture of their own which was distinct from those of the Serbian state in Zeta to the north, the First Bulgarian Empire in the lakeland area, and the Byzantine province of Epirus Nova.`` and you know that he says that Albanoi and Arbanoi are the current Albanians.  `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

Deleting user: Zscout370 Reasons given for deletion: User said Dr. Judy Wood is not a notable person and that my page had Copyright violations. Reasons I am appealing: Dr. Judy Wood is a notable person, because she is the ONLY 9/11 researcher to file her evidence in a court of law. One of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court! No other 9/11 researcher has accomplished so much in the pursuit of truth and justice, yet many other 9/11 researchers have their own Wikipedia pages. This is not fair. In addition, the material on her website is not only fair use since it is a public website (www.drjudywood.com), but also, I have personally contacted Dr. Judy Wood via email, and she has given me permission to use any and all of the information on her website. She has pledged to email the Wikipedia Permissions staff within 48 hours to inform them that I do indeed have permission to use the information on her webpage. Therefore, the two reasons given for deletion are invalid, and my attempts to discuss this deletion at the Talk:Judy Wood page, were also deleted!

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Endorse deletion. Even ignoring the possible copyright problems, the article had no reliable independent sources about Judy Wood, which is a basic requirement (see e.g. WP:BIOfor more info on this).   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Response: Notability: Considering Dr. Wood is the ONLY 9/11 Researcher ever to file her evidence in a court of law, and considering that one of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court in October 2009, she is MORE notable than many 9/11 researchers that have their own pages, yet only hers seems to be deleted. When I try to input her name into the 9/11 Truth Movement wikipedia page, someone keeps deleting her name and any links to her research or court cases! This is UNFAIR, and this is not what Wikipedia is all about. Censorship and Unfairness are NOT what Wikipedia is about. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Response: References: In addition, 3 of the 5 references used are from EXTERNAL SOURCES. 1 is from a government website, and 2 are from Academic Universities.

Please help Wikipedia, people are trying to censor Dr. Wood, and administrators have deleted the Wikipedia page that I created! This is unfair! Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*Response: Copyright Violation: I am also NOT in Copyright violation, because her information and photos are FAIR USE and are posted Publicly, but in addition to that, she has also given me permission personally, and will be emailing the Wikipedia Permission email to alert them to this within 48 hours.''

I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself.

The plot summary should stay as it was. Quotes at the beginning of the article are not a good idea.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't know if this is what you had in mind, but it's something I noticed a few years back. I first read TKAM in 1960 (I was 9) and since then I've read it at least once a year. It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening. Might not be what you want, but I think it's fascinating!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Atticus=protagonist? ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe quote in the second paragraph identifies Atticus as the protagonist, but I was always under the impression that Scout was the protagonist, since all the events revolve around her perspective (I even said she was the protagonist in my addition to the Plot Summary section.  Am I wrong, or is the quote mistaken, or what?  What needs to happen in either case? It may not even be that big of a deal, but I'd like to get an answer.  -  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Atticus is not described as the protagonist by the article, but by a legal writer. He has been the subject of more papers in legal journals than any of the other characters in any sort of writing, so it bears pointing out that fame in the lead.

Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHeavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls.

They based their objections to circumcision on five reasons (among which two directly refer to the Ten Commandments): (1) It was commanded to Abraham and not to Moses... (2) It is only mentioned only once in the Mosaic law; it is not repeated in Deuteronomy... All (their) reasons were answered by Orthodox rabbinical authorities. To counter this agitation, Leopold Zunz wrote his essay on circumcision (Gutachten ueber did Beschneidung, Frankfort, 1843). Today, most Reform Jews have their children circumcised. It is, however, often done by a surgeon with a rabbi in attendance to say the prayers, or without any ceremony at all.`` (see discussion for more information)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_6",dev,0

The July entry had to have been written in November since the event (the deaths/funeral music) was listed along with it. But in Mozart's catalog, he listed the MFM ahead of K.478 which was written in October. That sequence is one of several clues that he wrote it in a month preceeding October. For the category of the month of November, he did not enter the MFM. Why not? Because he wrote the piece in July - at least the CHORAL version. The 2 versions are nearly identical with the choral version essentially being the MFM with a chorus (for the most part). NEWLINE_TOKENI have a copy of Mozart's Thematic Catalog. NEWLINE_TOKENMozart mistakenly (?) entered K.478 under July also (rather than October), but at least he entered the sequence of the 2 pieces correctly: K.477, K.478. There's other evidence, but it gets very lengthy and complicated. The sequence of those 2 pieces in his catalog plus no mention of the MFM in November should be sufficient evidence that the original music for the MFM was not composed in November. It was just a VERSION of it which was done in November, nearly identical to the first one. He dated the MUSIC correctly, but omitted the first and lesser event of the elevation of a visitng Mason to Master in August. Doing catch-up work on his catalog in November, he listed the more important event: the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers in November for which it was performed again. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2 events, 1 set of music (essentially), composed prior to K.478, correctly listed under July for a Masonic ceremony in August, but the more important event (the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers) accompanied the entry, written in November due to some administrative procrastination on Mozart's part. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMozart normally entered the MUSIC only once in his catalog, not repeating an entry if it was essentially the same music for a different Event or purpose. NEWLINE_TOKENIn other words, his Thematic Catalog was primarily a book of Music - not Events, even though he also listed the event or person or opera, etc, along with it.NEWLINE_TOKENFor example, if one of his operas was revived or produced in some city for the first time, he didn't list it again in his catalog. That would be an Event-Driven catalog.

NEWLINE_TOKENHis catalog is slightly messed up on that page, but mostly correct, and with pieces listed in the correct sequence - which may have been more important to Mozart than listing the correct date. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf someone says ``July must be a mistake``, they need to have their ducks lined up and explain why he listed the MFM prior to an October piece, and why he didn't list it under November. NEWLINE_TOKENThe ``mistake`` theory is a push-button ejection seat, in some cases, and carried to extremes, one could claim that Beethoven wrote the MFM, with scholars mistakenly believing that it was Mozart's handwriting on the score and in the catalog.

I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.     : EDATA_6",dev,0

You should cite more than just you think it is and explain specifically why you think that it is. There are many other Wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many different things, one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts. These articles include titles like, rapist, criminal, pedophile, murderer, thief, organized crime boss and many others. Just look at the OJ Simpson article, it makes reference to accusations against him for murder in the first sentence. Where this title is seems to be at issue for some reason. Wikipdeia articles are usually vastly different in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in different places throughout the articles. Since there is no debate as to whether Roman Polanski is a rapist or not, and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie career should it not be included in the first sentence? Is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed? Should a person's most prominent title be their career, their ethnicity, place of origin, or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life? What specific guideline specifies this? Should it merely be what the person is best known for, because Roman Polanski is very well known for having raped a 13 year old girl and for being a movie director. Many people would say he is not known for his acting as he has few notable roles, or writing as he has written very little, but these titles appear in the first sentence of his article.`  : EDATA_6",dev,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

Since AfD isn't a vote but a discussion, your recent contributions haven't been as helpful as you might hope; in addition to a 'keep' or 'delete,' some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards is needed.  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful. -  ·  NEWLINE_TOKEN:hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count. a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSkyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, ``Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites``, Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour  : EDATA_6",dev,0

The death certificatenot my original researchsays ``Date of Suicide September 16,`` as does the police report, Coroners Report, and Inquest. The date of death given as September 18, 1932, is because that was when she was DECLARED DEAD by the coroner. If the coroner had not examined the body for another hour and eleven minutes, Peg's death date would have been recorded as September 19, for he would have declared her dead at 12:01 AM, yet the date of suicide would remain September 16, for the coroner knew the rate of decay. That was the way it was done in 1930s Los Angeles....The coroner knew what he was doingGwen didn't. I have official documents provided to me by the City of Los Angeles, yet Gwen would rather what? Use a newspaper as a more verifiable source than these, or just pick one section of the death certificate without reading the entire document? Has she even read it? All of it?

At any rate, the article stood on its legs for many months before Gwen brought the hatchet. I care about Wikipedia, too, and I am concerned about unverifiable entries making their way into any article. I fully remember when Wiki was the laughing stock of the Internet and scholarship in general. Did you see how many pages Gwen used up in the ``View History`` and then had the nerve, the gall, to tell me she ``tweaked`` it? She didn't tweak it, she rewrote the damn thing. And would it not have been a polite courtesy to first talk over all the edits? This, more than anything, is why there are so many ill feelings between contributors on Wiki. Too many are simply too head strong to think, ``Wait a sec, so and so has obviously done a lot of work here, maybe I should talk some things over with him  to reach a concensus and make a better article.`` That's what a professional editor would dothat's what my book editor does with me...and isn't that what Britannica and all other encyclopedia editors do?  `  : EDATA_6",dev,1

It is the paragraph in question, especially the example in that paragraph, which distorts the workings of evolution.  The phrase “it need only increase at a rate of 0.005 cm per generation (= 50 cm/10,000)” easily gives the impression of progressive linear change.  The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution.  From these I have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions.  Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy.

252450129,"SDATA_6 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENThanks Mackan, for the assist.  I am not sure I follow all points contested above; if anyone's wondering, no I did not find the oafishness or general vulgarity of mind displayed on that talk page to be lovable.  I am not particularly exercised about this, and though I think the block was illegitimate, I have no plan to pursue the matter further.  The only statement in this thread that I find objectionable is Shell's professed wish to see me ``take civility more seriously in the future.``  I take civility very seriously, Shell; indeed I believe I take it more seriously than you do.  I think your careless suggestion to the contrary – like the ill-considered block itself – reflects a slack, even indefensible understanding of WP:CIVIL, wherein the only measure of incivility is the temperature of remarks. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am also a little puzzled by your reading of nine or ten identical frat-boy beer belches as a ``commendable`` effort to ``keep things light.``  We all have different sensibilities, and you're certainly entitled to yours.  But be aware that here is my attempt to keep things light in the face of obstructionism.  Note that in this case there is a point to the playfulness: the weight, authority, influence, and reliability of sources is not – contra Jayjg – a function of their print run.  Jay's response to this lightness was to say, again and again, that I had ``strawmanned`` him (while steadfastly refusing to clarify his point or show how I'd distorted it), then to attack me directly and personally and say I've never in the past shown the ``grace or honesty to admit`` when I've lied about such matters, and so was unlikely to admit my deceptions in this instance.  And then began the beer-belching frat-boy hazing extravaganza you found so commendably charming.  All of this in a thread that began with Jay's personal attack on PR, alongside the spurious point downplaying Haaretz as a source – the same spurious point all subsequent accurate references to which he dismissed as ``strawmen``.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne girl's trash is another's treasure, Shell, and while you have the right to be charmed by what you find charming, you shouldn't conclude that those with different sensibilities have manners less beautiful than yours.  Suffering fools gladly is not the only measure of Wikipedia etiquette.  `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

Google this: ``statistical divisions`` site:un.orgNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term ``statistical divisions``, or the wrong organization term  ``Statistics Division`` to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as ``UN geoscheme``. Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:NEWLINE_TOKEN*``The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)``NEWLINE_TOKEN*``... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different ``statistical divisions`` (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term ``UN geoscheme`` is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  ``UN geoscheme`` is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 .

When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain ``bulk`` properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.

You did not mention a source for this, and you might be right, but first of all, you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon. The first one is Drepanodon Nesti, 1826, which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published; the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy, 1861, the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus. As you did not mention any justification for your edit, I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus. An extra reason for me to do this, was that it would be far more likely for the older name, given to the remains of a carnivore, to apparently represent another species of carnivore, than it would be for a name given to saurian remains. Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here, as far as I can see.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the same edit, you removed the name M. copeanus Marsh, 1869, from the list of invalid or dubious species, because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus. The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus, but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus. If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus, then just removing it from the list is removing information. On the other hand, adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information. Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere, and wants to find out more about it, and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia, it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne last thing: am I right in suspecting you to be the same user as , another user with a keen interest in saurians but lacking that extra bit of skills in the field of taxonomy?    `  : EDATA_6",dev,0

(talking mainly about the title part)    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Reverted. Thanks for bringing it up!   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENoi todo bem!!!!!!!!!!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Romeo and Juliet comparison ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):NEWLINE_TOKEN````Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,`` said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. ``We took from the best.````NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI see this has been discussed before and there doesn't seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that's the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There's an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let's just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare's plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden's claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer's own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer's mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as ``The writer of the play claimed that...`` as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I'd be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren't that creative.    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their ``gangs``, the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let's see - Grease wasn't a tragedy either (except its message of ``dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted``.  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have.

Is there a citation to support your claim that only PTs, DOs, MDs do manipulation whereas chiropractors perform adjustments?  The intent business is antiquated; it does not reflect the contemporary sources.  Lastly, the subluxation bit is way overblown, it's used interchangeably with joint dysfunction.     : EDATA_6",dev,0

I tried fixing it but understood that it was getting updated by itself after some lag, so I did nothing. But for your note on my talkpage, I'd have missed this week's INCOTW. Good to see your participation in WikiProject Indian cinema, lots needs to be done for Telugu cinema. I've been a destructive influence, mostly tagging articles on Savitri and Bhanumati as copyvios. But for Missamma and Maayabazaar, not many classic telugu movies seem to be represented. If you are interested, you may want to have a go at them, but some suggestions: Try to develop an article at one go so that we can get it featured on DYK; If it is people, add Category:Telugu people; if it is films, add Category:Telugu films; and of course, as you would know, copyvios are no-no but some sources like telugucinema.com can be good source material for facts and trivia.    : EDATA_6",dev,0

It isn't necessarily a different perspective on what constitutes moral behavior. In Islamic rules of warfare, one isn't to take a life out of anger, and this is reflected in a tradition in which Ali (Muhammad's nephew) forced himself to refrain from killing a man whom he defeated in battle, simply because he realized that anger would motivate his action. Of course, Saddam isn't much of a Muslim. For whatever reason, there's an atmosphere of chaos and apathy in many of the Arab states. Maybe it's a vacuum left after European control, who knows.
